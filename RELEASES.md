**01/11/2018**

## New

* **ET1 & ET3:** Add Google Tag Manager for better analytics. (RST-1424) 
* **Admin:** Add rake task for Policy Team's data extraction. (RST-1483 & RST-1488)

## Changes

* **ET1:** Refactored views to remove Rails presenters as they add complexity.
ET1 views are now easier for developers to work with. (RST-1440)
* **ET1:** Allow PDFs to be flattened based upon environment configuration.
We can now retrieve answers more easily in environments other than test,
although this is still flattened by default in production.
* **ET3:** Removed bootsnap for developers and test builds as it causes issues while debugging.
It remains as is in production environments.
* **ET3:** Add the ability to run a developer version of S3.
This means we can test the rtf upload more reliably. (RST-1277)
* **API:** Make changes in the database to ensure `employment_details` are properly shown as empty when a Claim is first made. (RST-1483)

## Fixes

* **API:** Fix a bug where hidden UTF characters were preventing ATOS from working properly.
This will enable some cases which were held in sidekiq to go through.
* **API:** Backdate the change to empty `employment_details` on all existing Claims. (RST-1483)

## Security

* Updated vulnerable gems in ET3 (RST-1432)

* RST-1354 - PRODUCTION PROBLEM: UTF-8 encoded files. All files going to ethos will now be in 'windows-1252' code page (suitable for windows server 2003).  This has been verified as working with CGI

## Info

No downtime expected/observed

As this changes the files going to ETHOS, there is a risk that ETHOS may reject these files.  This has been mitigated by producing an example file and requesting that this was tested.
